DANA (Distributed (asynchronous) Numerical and Adaptive computing) is a python
computing framework based on numpy and scipy libraries whose primary goals
relate to computational neuroscience and artificial neural networks. However,
this framework can be used in several different areas like physic simulations,
cellular automata or image processing. The computational paradigm supporting
the dana framework is grounded on the notion of a unit that is a set of
arbitrary values that can vary along time under the influence of other units
and learning. Each unit can be linked to any other unit (including itself)
using a weighted connection and a group is a structured set of such homogeneous
units.
